As a student exploring the software development life cycle (SDLC), I am documenting my journey and the best practices I discover along the way. This repository includes my personal experiences and references to quality resources, with a focus on a wide range of topics related to software development such as naming conventions, commit message standards, documentation guidelines, tool recommendations, environment package management, testing, continuous integration/continuous deployment, and release processes. My goal is to create a comprehensive guide to the SDLC, covering all stages and branches. Please note that my knowledge and understanding are still developing, and I welcome collaboration and contributions from others.
